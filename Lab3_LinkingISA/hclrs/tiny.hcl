register pP {  
    # our own internal register. P_pc is its output, p_pc is its input.
	pc:64 = 0; # 64-bits wide; 0 is its default value.
	
	# we could add other registers to the P register bank
	# register bank should be a lower-case letter and an upper-case letter, in that order.
	
	# there are also two other signals we can optionally use:
	# "bubble_P = true" resets every register in P to its default value
	# "stall_P = true" causes P_pc not to change, ignoring p_pc's value
} 

# "pc" is a pre-defined input to the instruction memory and is the 
# address to fetch 10 bytes from (into pre-defined output "i10bytes").
pc = P_pc;

# we can define our own input/output "wires" of any number of 0<bits<=80
wire opcode:8, icode:4;

# the x[i..j] means "just the bits between i and j".  x[0..1] is the 
# low-order bit, similar to what the c code "x&1" does; "x&7" is x[0..3]
opcode = i10bytes[0..8];   # first byte read from instruction memory
icode = opcode[4..8];      # top nibble of that byte

/* we could also have done i10bytes[4..8] directly, but I wanted to
 * demonstrate more bit slicing... and all 3 kinds of comments      */

# named constants can help make code readable
const TOO_BIG = 0xC; # the first unused icode in Y86-64

# some named constants are built-in: the icodes, ifuns, STAT_??? and REG_???


# Stat is a built-in output; STAT_HLT means "stop", STAT_AOK means 
# "continue".  The following uses the mux syntax described in the 
# textbook
Stat = [
	icode == HALT : STAT_HLT;
	1             : STAT_AOK;

# let's also read and write a register in the register file; to do that we
# first pick a register to read
reg_srcA = REG_RAX;
# and a register to write; in this case the same one
reg_dstE = REG_RAX;
# and a value to write.  Let's decide what to do based on the ifun
reg_inputE = [
	opcode[0..4] == 0 : reg_outputA - opcode;
	opcode[0..4] == 1 : reg_outputA + opcode;
	opcode[0..4] == 2 : reg_outputA * opcode;
	1 : reg_outputA + opcode + opcode;

# to make progress, we have to update the PC...
p_pc = P_pc + 1; # you may use math ops directly...
